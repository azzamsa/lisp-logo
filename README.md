# Lisp Logo

![Lisp logo](https://github.com/azzamsa/lisp-logo/blob/master/logos/lisp-lizard-with-text.svg)

I attempt to make the svg version of [Manfred Spiller's lizard lisp web-badge](https://web.archive.org/web/20060105182921/http://www.normal-null.de/lisp_logo.html)
logo with the help of my friend [Raga Punggawa](twitter.com/pagarmidna), who is a graphic designer, because the original site just provide the png and jpg version.

I don't know what is the exact license of this logo, it stated in wayback machine archive, because the original site is down

I hope Manfred Spiller allowing me to make the svg version of the logo, if something bad happened I will adapt the logo of [JSCL](https://github.com/jscl-project/jscl)
